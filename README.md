## The problem

Research labs contain hundreds, if not thousands, of supplies and equipment. There are many instances where researchers are working on an important experiment only to realize theyâ€™ve run out of a crucial reagent. This happens often because it is difficult to keep track of all of the supplies and reagents within a lab.

## The solution

Storeroom is a lab supply management application that makes it easier to track and manage everything within a lab. This way, scientists can focus more on the science, and less on the logistics.
